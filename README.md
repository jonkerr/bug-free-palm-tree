# Ensemble Model Prediction of Economic Downturns
MADS Milestone 2 Project

## Getting Started
### Configuring Conda

To configure your conda environment with all the same libraries as compatible with this project, run:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

As with all conda environments, be sure to activate the (newly created) conda environment before using:
```
conda activate mads_milestone2
```

If using VS Code, be sure to use the same for Jupyter kernel

```
Select kernel -> Python Environments -> mads_milestone2
```
